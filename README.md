# CefBox
A serial of simple tools for building desktop app under route-like develop mode based on cefsharp.

Thanks to the appearance of cef, we can build cool desktop app with html5 in a more effective way. And as an .neter, cefsharp is the most effective tool to build windows desktop app with html5. 

However, the primary manner of the interop between js and bounded object is mad if we build complex app that contains frequent communications between them. Besides, the window's border provided by operation system is not in harmony with our apps sometimes.
...

As you can see, CefBox is the one to solve these problems for you. 

## Goals
- auto register route path by service names and action names.
- refer to .net core middleware, building a more extensibility app with a pipeline-like process when receiving rpc request from js.
- provide borderless winform frame that can host local html5 application.
